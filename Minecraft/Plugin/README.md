# Minecraft Chat Filter Consequence Plugin for Server Admins

Uses regular expressions. When a player types in chat the word "Queen" or any expression of it the player is struck by lightning. I coded this because someone kept calling me Queen. I warned them it's never a good idea to mess with an admin. They tried Q.u.e.e.n, Q/u/e/e/n, and other attempts but the regular expression catches most of it. They kept killing themselves over and over trying to get around the filter. It is possible to get around but they'll die a lot before they figure out how.

Killing a player with lightning is set as a boolean. Yes/No

It's up to you if you want it to be a visual effect only or actually kill players with regular expressions.

With more modification you can re-code it for different chat triggering purposes.

Handy for foul language filters where there is a penalty for cursing.
