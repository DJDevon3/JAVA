# Minecraft Plugin for Server Admins

Uses regular expressions. When a player types in chat the word "Queen" or any expression of it the player is struck by lightning. I coded this because someone kept calling me Queen. I warned them it's never a good idea to mess with an admin.

Killing a player with lightning is set as a boolean. Yes/No

It's up to you if you want it to be a visual effect only or actually kill players with regular expressions.

With more modification you can re-code it for different chat triggering purposes.

Handy for foul language filters where there is a penalty for cursing.
